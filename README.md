# Multilayer GNNs and Network Embeddings for Predictive Analysis in Energy Networks
This repository contains the Python code and resources for the paper "Multilayer GNNs and Network Embeddings for Predictive Analysis in Energy Networks." The project aims to apply Multilayer Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Network Embeddings to incident data recorded on PMUs (Phasor Measurement Units) from OGE (Oklahoma Gas & Electric) between 2015 and 2021. The project is divided into three key parts:

1- Classical Machine Learning: Using raw data and selected features for predictive analysis.
2- Multilayer Network Embeddings: Using the multi-node2vec algorithm to embed multilayer network structures.
3- Multilayer GNNs: Applying Explainable Multilayer GNNs (EMGNN) for node-level and edge-level predictions.
